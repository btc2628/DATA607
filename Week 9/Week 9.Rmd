# Introduction

In this program I will be extracting the top selling books from September 15th, 2022.
```{r}
api_key <- "61NbssiPqEoTys1jWPNaloqpxWxTAK3i"
url <- paste0("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists/2022-09-15/hardcover-fiction.json?api-key=", api_key)
response <- GET(url)
```

```{r}
books_data <- content(response, "text")
json_books <- fromJSON(books_data)
```

```{r}
df_books <- as.data.frame(json_books$results$books)
kable(df_books[, c(11, 1:3)], caption = "NY Times Best Sellers 09/15/2022")
```
# Conclusion
Here we have a fully extracted list of the best sellers, we can see that 4 of the top 5 are new to the list this week and the remaining one has been on the list for 3 weeks.
